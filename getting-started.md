This is great for an all Win environment, but I don't actually recommend an all Win environment if you are going
to be doing any serious development. None the less, you'll need a basic ruby even in a split environment and this
gets you the basics for that.

[ For serious dev ]

Here's what I use. Other versions are also valid. YMMV
- Rubymine running in windows accessing local disk
- VirtualBox VM with ubuntu
- Shared folders to give a common work area between Win and Ubuntu
- PuTTY for using ssh windows into the VM.


more details TBD
